### TakeHomeGDV
Take home task for demonstration of technical skills.

# Geospatial Data Visualisation App
Project that aligns to the criteria listed in the take home assessment requirements.:
-   **Sampling of 100000 locations**
    - Completed to spec, sampled using bivariate normal distribution with Standard deviation of 10km
    - Centered around London: **LAT 51.5074 LON -0.1278**
    - generation of points utilises deviation based on metres, not on lon/lat.
- **Data stored in PostGIS**
    - uses predictable schema of GEOM with additional values for debugging
- **Frontend**
    - interactive map interface with panning, zooming completed with the help of maplibre.
    - performance of rendering dots was initially poor, with excessive CPU draw, but has been reduced with usage of psycopg pool to _ as well as optimisations to SQL query.
    - visual clarity at different zoom levels is currently not something addressed, but would likely be improved with a LOD of the map. The points themselves reduce in density with zoom and so remain viewable regardless.

## Tech Selection


### Database
- **PostgreSQL + PostGIS**
  - Stores generated point data in WGS84 (EPSG:4326)
  - /* add something about how the format makes it quick to do operations with
  - PostGIS used as is required of the spec, helping with quick calculations

### Backend
- **Python (FastAPI)**
  - Serves Mapbox Vector Tiles (MVT) on demand
  - Returns the data required for the current map viewport
  - Dockerized

### Frontend
- **MapLibre GL JS**
  - WebGL-based rendering of vector tiles
  - Smooth pan and zoom interactions
  - very basic HTML/JS.

### Infrastructure
- **Docker & Docker Compose**
  - 1. PostGIS database container
  - 2. Backend API container (currently hosts frontend)

## Architecture

1. **Data Generation**
   - Points are sampled from a bivariate normal distribution
   - Centered on London (**LAT 51.5074 LON -0.1278** )
   - Standard deviation: 10 km longitude and latitude directions
   - Coordinates stored in EPSG:4326 (WGS84)

2. **Storage**
   - Points stored in a PostGIS table with a geometry column
   - GiST spatial index used for fast bounding-box queries

3. **Backend Tile Service**
   - Frontend requests tiles using `{z}/{x}/{y}` URLs
   - Backend constructs a tile envelope
   - Points are spatially filtered by bounding box
   - Results are encoded as Mapbox Vector Tiles (PBF)

4. **Frontend Rendering**
   - MapLibre requests tiles based on viewport and zoom level
   - Points rendered as circle layers on a basemap
   - Rendering handled entirely on the GPU via WebGL
   - CURRENTLY loaded and hosted by backend container (cheap solution was acceptable for 6-8 hour takehome task)


## Performance Optimizations

### Implemented
- **Vector tiles**
  - only visible data transferred to the client
  - Minimizes network usage and browser memory footprint
- **Spatial indexing (GiST)**
  - Efficient bounding-box filtering in PostGIS
- **Viewport-driven loading**
  - No full-dataset fetch at any point


- The application is smooth during pan/zoom (this is not my work, this is )
- Rapid zooming causes database CPU usage spikes due to:
  - Multiple concurrent tile requests
  - Per-tile geometry transformation and MVT encoding
  - resultant effect of sharp unloaded zones when zooming in and out rapidly
    - not dissimilar to own experience when using competitor map services
- This behavior is expected when generating vector tiles on demand without caching or aggregation

### Future Improvements
- Precompute and store geometries to avoid transforming with every request
- add grid-based clustering to reduce calculations
- Optimise database connection pool to reduce connection overhead

## Visual Clarity at Scale

in future a LOD system would be beneficial, both for visual clarity (increase detail on ground as camera zooms) as at close zoom levels, lack of local detail impedes navigation, and additionally LOD for points such as grouping them at distance. The advantage of this would be obvious performance increases, at no cost of visual fidelity at those zoom levels.

## Trade offs


## Running Locally


Generate the 100k points first throught the script in scripts
```bash
python scripts/generator.py --n 100000 --center-lat 51.5074 --center-lon -0.1278 --std-km 10  --out tmp/points_100k.csv --seed 42
```

run the below on the TAKEHOMEGDV directory to create dockerised db and backend.
```bash
docker compose up --build
```


## Additional notes

Differences in performance from my own may arise from the platform (likely improvements); Docker image used for the postGIS is amd64, and technically incompatible for MAC, but ran well enough for this project.
